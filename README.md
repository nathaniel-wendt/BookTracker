# BookTracker - a React Web App to track what you read!

## Description 
A web application built in React to track books you're interested in.
The main page (BookCase.js) contains three shelves for organizing your books, separating the books you are 
currently reading from books you would like to read and books you have already read.

You also have the ability to search for any book within the BooksAPI dynamically. You have the ability to see
what shelf (if any) each book is on, as well as the ability to move any book from one shelf to another.

## Dependencies

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

  `$ npm install --save react-router-dom`
  `$ npm install --save react-debounce-input`
